# Direct3D 12 port of AntTweakBar

Needs Visual studio 2015 and the Direct3D sdk that comes with it.

There are currently no binaries, you need to compile it yourself.

Resources are not released, this is a first commit.

But, it works.

### Original Readme.txt from AntTweakBar development library follows

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based 
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

This package includes the development version of the AntTweakBar library 
for Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX, and some program examples (sources + binaries).
